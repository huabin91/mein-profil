# 1 Git Basics

This chapter covers all the basic local Git oprations:
* creating or cloning a reponsitory;
* staging and committing those changes;
* remote repository;
* viewing the history of all the changes the repository.

## 1.1 Cloning an Existing Respository
```
$ git clone <url>
```
when you run `git clone`, every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default.

### 1.1.1 For Example

```
$ git clone https://github.com/huabin91/test/demo1
```
Details of the progress after this step of operation:
1.  **create** a directory named demo1;
2. **initializes** a `.git` directory inside it;
3. **pulls down** all the data for that repository;
4. **checke out** a working copy of **the lastest version**.  

## 1.2 Access Git Repository

Git can use major protocols to transfer data: Local, HTTP, **Secure Shell (SSH)**ã€‚

### 1.2.1 The SSH Protocol
SSH access to server is already set up in most places. To clone a Git repository over SSH:

```
$ git clone ssh://user@servier:project.git
or
$ git clone user@servier:project.git
```
But before using the SSH protocol to access the Git server, we need to add our **personal SSH public key** to the Git server.

you schould check to mack sure you don't already have a key. By default, a user's SSH keys are stored in that user's `~/.ssh` directory.

```
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls
	id_dsa
	id_dsa.pub
```
If you don't have these files, you can create them by running a progam called `ssh-keygen` (specific operation please check online). 
 All they have to do is copy the contents of the `.pub` file add to Git server.

## 1.3 Recording Changes to the Repository
You need to mack some changes and commit snapshots of those changes into your repository.

**Remember** that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: `tracked` or `untracked`. Tracked files are files that were in the last **snapshot**. they can be `unmodified`, `modified`, or `staged`. Untracked files are everything else (any files in your working directory that were not in you last snapshot and not in your staging area).

**Untracked** basically means that Git sees a file you don't have in the previous snapshot (commit).

### 1.3.1 Checking the Status of Your Files
```
$ git status
```
### 1.3.2 Tracking News Files
```
$ git add <file> / git add .
```
Add this content to the next commit. **If you modify a file after you run git add, you have to run git again to stage the lastest version of the file.**
### 1.3.3 Committing Your Changes
```
$ git commit -m "<commit message>"
```
## 1.4 View the Commit History
```
$ git log 
```
### 1.4.1 Output-Formatting Options
* `git log -p`, show the difference introduced in each commit;
* `git log --stat`,  prints a list of modified files, how many files were changed, and how many lines in those files were added and removed;
* `git log --pretty=?`, a few prebuild options: oneline, short, full, fuller, format. 
### 1.4.2 Limiting Options
Options that let you show  only a subset of commits.

## 1.5 Undoing Things
When you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you muss up you commit message.
```
$ git commit --amend
$ git commit -m '<commit new message>'
$ git add <forgotten_file>
$ git commit --amend
```
## 1.6 Removing Files
To remove a file from Git, you have to **remove it from your tracked files and then commit**; 
If you modify the file and added it to the index already, you must force the removal with the -f option.
```
$ git rm <file> 

$ git rm --cached <file>
```
## 1.7 Working with Remotes

 ### 1.7.1 Showing Your Remotes
```
$ git remote -v
```
### 1.7.2 Adding Remote Repositories
```
$ git remote add <shortname> <url>
```
### 1.7.3 Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes
```
$ git fetch <remote-name>
```
The `git fetch` command pulls the data to your local repository, it doesn't automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you're currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you're ready.
```
$ git pull <remote-name>
```
You can use the `git pull` command to automatically fetch and then merge a remote branch into your current branch.
### 1.7.4 Pushing to Your Remotes
```
$ git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
```
## 1.8 Ignoring Files

you can create a file listing patterns to match them named `.gitignore`. Setting up a `.gitignore` file before you get going is generally a good idea so you don't accidentally commit files that you really don't want in your Git repository

```
*.a         # no .a files
!.a         # but to track lib.a, event though you're ignoring .a files above
/TODO       # only ignore the root TODO file, not subdir/TODO
build/      # ignore all files in the build/ directory
doc/*.txt   # ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
```

Github maintains a fairly comprehensive list of good .gitignore file examples for dozens or projects and languages at https://github.com/github/gitignore .
